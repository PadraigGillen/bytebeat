# bytebeat
this thing that is somehow a thing

This repo contains a C source file and Makefile to rapidly switch between melodies, and allow for easy experimentation.

## Links I found useful
- [Implementation](http://www.windows93.net/#!bytebeat) in-browser (My original encounter)
- [Writeup](http://viznut.fi/texts-en/bytebeat_algorithmic_symphonies.html) by the first person to publicize the idea
- [Reference](http://canonical.org/~kragen/bytebeat/) that got me started on writing my own C bytebeat generators
- [Video compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCRPUv8V22o) of a few interesting examples
